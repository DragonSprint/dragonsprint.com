:summary: Beginners guide to Ljubljana

At the crossroads of different cultures, regions, and historical developments
=============================================================================

Ljubljana lies halfway between Vienna and Venice, at the crossroads of different cultures, geographical regions, and historical developments. Its location within a convenient two-hour flight from almost all major European airports makes it an easily accessible destination.

Ljubljana is renowned for its relaxed atmosphere, reminiscent both of the Mediterranean and Central Europe, and is well-known as an extremely picturesque and green city. Particularly the historical city centre is full of outstanding architecture, a medley of styles from different periods in history, most notably the Baroque, bound together into one of the 20th century's most amazing total works of art by the famous Ljubljana-born architect and urban planner Jože Plečnik.

Getting to and around Ljubljana
===============================


Getting around

Ljubljana is small enough that you can walk to most places. `Public buses <https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/visitors/explore-the-region/traffic-and-transport/city-buses/>`_ are safe and on time, a single journey (90mins) costs 1.2€. You can also book a free electric taxi `Kavalir <https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/visitors/explore-the-region/traffic-and-transport/kavalir-getting-around-the-city-centre-by-electric-car/>`_.

By Plane
--------

Ljubljana has its own airport "Joze Pučnik" or "Brnik", but a lot of people also use nearby airports in Italy (Trieste, Treviso, Venice, Verona, Milano, Bologna), Croatia (Zagreb, Rijeka), Austria (Graz, Vienna) and Hungary (Budapest). Most of these are less than two hours away, with regular van/bus shuttles by `GoOpti <https://www.goopti.com/>`_.

By Van
------

A very popular way to get to/from nearby airports and also to not-so-nearby places, such as Munich,
Milano or Vienna, is the van sharing service `GoOpti <https://www.goopti.com/>`_. They are reliable and affordable. A return ticket from Munich to Ljubljana and back, as of this writing, costs 92€ while a return ticket from Ljubljana's Brnik airport to the city center is 16€.

Foodie revolution
=================

In recent years, we've had a full on foodie revolution in Ljubljana! A ton of crazy places open up every month and we'll do our best to show you around. We also have a booming culture of streetfood, everything from burgers & fries, kebabs to Balkan specialties such as "burek".

Besides food, beer is a huge thing. We currently have more than 70 (!!) breweries in Slovenia (population of only 2 million) and a great number of their award-winning brews can be found in pubs around Ljubljana.

December is a special time of year for people in Ljubljana: every day after work, hundreds of us flock to the old city center to warm ourselves up with mulled wine, enjoy good company and listen to live music. Cold? Meh.
